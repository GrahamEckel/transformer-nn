            "\n                  Introduction and objectives\n                  The COVID-19 outbreak has had an unclear impact on the treatment and outcomes of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The aim of this study was to assess changes in STEMI management during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n               \n                  Methods\n                  Using a multicenter, nationwide, retrospective, observational registry of consecutive patients who were managed in 75 specific STEMI care centers in Spain, we compared patient and procedural characteristics and in-hospital outcomes in 2 different cohorts with 30-day follow-up according to whether the patients had been treated before or after COVID-19.\n               \n                  Results\n                  Suspected STEMI patients treated in STEMI networks decreased by 27.6% and patients with confirmed STEMI fell from 1305 to 1009 (22.7%). There were no differences in reperfusion strategy (> 94% treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention in both cohorts). Patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention during the COVID-19 outbreak had a longer ischemic time (233 [150-375] vs 200 [140-332] minutes, P\n                     <.001) but showed no differences in the time from first medical contact to reperfusion. In-hospital mortality was higher during COVID-19 (7.5% vs 5.1%; unadjusted OR, 1.50; 95%CI, 1.07-2.11; P <.001); this association remained after adjustment for confounders (risk-adjusted OR, 1.88; 95%CI, 1.12-3.14; P\n                     =.017). In the 2020 cohort, there was a 6.3% incidence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection during hospitalization.\n               \n                  Conclusions\n                  The number of STEMI patients treated during the current COVID-19 outbreak fell vs the previous year and there was an increase in the median time from symptom onset to reperfusion and a significant 2-fold increase in the rate of in-hospital mortality. No changes in reperfusion strategy were detected, with primary percutaneous coronary intervention performed for the vast majority of patients. The co-existence of STEMI and SARS-CoV-2 infection was relatively infrequent.\n               "

            "\n Objectives\n To evaluate maternal and perinatal outcomes in high compared to low-risk pregnancies complicated by SARS-COV-2 infection.\n \n Methods\n This was a multinational retrospective cohort study including women with laboratory-confirmed SARS-COV-2 from 76 centers from 25 different countries in Europe, United States, South America, Asia and Australia from 04 April 2020 till 28 October 2020. The primary outcome was a composite measure of maternal mortality and morbidity including admission to intensive care unit (ICU), use of mechanical ventilation, or death. Secondary outcome was a composite measure of adverse perinatal outcome, including miscarriage, fetal loss, neonatal (NND) and perinatal (PND) death, and admission to neonatal intensive care unit. All these outcomes were assessed in high-risk compared to low-risk pregnancies. Pregnancies were considered as high risk in case of either pre-existing chronic medical conditions pre-existing pregnancy or obstetric disorders occurring in pregnancy. Fisher-test and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the data.\n \n Results\n 887 singleton pregnancies tested positive to SARS-COV-2 at RT-PCR nasal and pharyngeal swab were included in the study. The risk of composite adverse maternal outcome was higher in high compared to low risk-pregnancies with an OR of 1.52 (95% CU 1.03-2.24; p= 0.035). Likewise, women carrying a high risk-pregnancies were also at higher risk of hospital admission (OR: 1.48, 95% CI 1.07-2.04; p= 0.002), presence of severe respiratory symptoms (OR: 2.13, 95% CI .41-3.21; p= 0.001), admission to ICU (OR: 2.63, 95% CI 1.42-4.88) and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR: 2.65, 95% CI 1.19- 5.94; p= .002). When exploring perinatal outcomes, high-risk pregnancies were also at high risk of adverse perinatal outcome with an OR 0f 1.78 (95% CI .15-2.72; p= 0.009). However, such association was mainly due to the higher incidence of miscarriage in high risk compared to low risk pregnancies (5.3% vs 1.6%, p= 0.008), while there was no difference as regard as the other explored outcomes between the two study groups. At logistic regression analysis, maternal age (OR: 1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.22, p= 0.023) and the presence of a high-risk pregnancies (OR: 4.21, 95% CI 3.90-5.11, p<0.001) were independently associated with adverse maternal outcome.\n \n Conclusions\n High-risk pregnancies complicated by SARS-COV-2 infection are at higher risk of adverse maternal outcome compared to low-risk gestations.\n"

            "\n Abstract\n \n We discuss a patient who presented with fever, chills and rigors, myalgia, sore throat, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. The total white blood cell count was normal. The lymphocyte and platelet counts were within normal limits. There was no contact with confirmed COVID-19 patient, but the disease was circulating at the time of presentation. He admitted to anosmia and hypogeusia. A nasopharyngeal swab r-RT PCR test was positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. His chest examination and chest x-ray were normal. The patient had contact with animals and consumed unpasteurized camel milk. Both the blood culture and brucella serology tests were positive.\n This case illustrates that co-infection can occur and it is important to rule out endemic diseases in patients with COVID-19. Similarly, patients presenting with febrile endemic diseases may be harboring mild SARS-COV-2 virus infections and may need to be screened when the disease is suggested by epidemiological exposure.\n \n"

            "TRIM25 is a ubiquitin E3 ligase active in innate immunity and cell fate decisions. Mounting evidence suggests that TRIM25\u2032s E3 ligase activity is regulated by RNAs. However, while mutations affecting RNA binding have been described, neither the precise RNA binding site has been identified nor which domains are involved. Here, we present biophysical evidence for the presence of RNA binding sites on both TRIM25 PRY/SPRY and coiled-coil domains, and map the binding site on the PRY/SPRY with residue resolution. Cooperative RNA-binding of both domains enhances their otherwise transient interaction in solution and increases the E3 ligase activity of TRIM25. We also show that TRIM25 not only binds RNA in mammalian cells but that interfering with RNA binding has an effect on cellular RIG-I ubiquitination."

            "Pharmacists have a role in educating patients on the self-management of their medications, using accurate medicines lists. Thus, pharmacy students need to be adequately trained and assessed in health-literacy skills to be competent for future patient-education consultations using medicines lists. Performance-based assessments using patient simulation are often utilized to examine students\u2019 competence in clinical knowledge and communication skills. Due to COVID-19, education systems changed to remote online delivery utilizing video conferencing platforms (i.e., ZoomTM), which proved challenging for performance-based assessments. These challenges include difficulty in observing non-verbal cues over ZoomTM and not having adequate internet access. Adaptations to reduce reliance on internet access were made where students submitted a video-recording task wherein they educated a simulated patient on a medicines list, under lockdown restrictions during the pandemic. A total of 304 submissions were received where students performed the role-play with a simulated patient, such as their family members, housemates or peers either at home in person or via ZoomTM. Although it was not an original goal of the task, the collaborative effort between pharmacy instructors, students and the public helped increase awareness of medicines lists through this task."

            "Surgical healthcare has been prioritised in the Southern African Development Community (SADC), a regional intergovernmental entity promoting equitable and sustainable economic growth and socioeconomic development. However, challenges remain in translating political prioritisation into effective and equitable surgical healthcare. The AfroSurg Collaborative (AfroSurg) includes clinicians, public health professionals and social scientists from six SADC countries; it was created to identify context-specific, critical areas where research is needed to inform evidence-grounded policy and implementation. In January 2020, 38 AfroSurg members participated in a theory of change (ToC) workshop to agree on a vision: \u2018An African-led, regional network to enable evidence-based, context-specific, safe surgical care, which is accessible, timely, and affordable for all, capturing the spirit of Ubuntu[1]\u2019 and to identify necessary policy and service-delivery knowledge needs to achieve this vision. A unified ToC map was created, and a Delphi survey was conducted to rank the top five priority knowledge needs. In total, 45 knowledge needs were identified; the top five priority areas included (1) mapping of available surgical services, resources and providers; (2) quantifying the burden of surgical disease; (3) identifying the appropriate number of trainees; (4) identifying the type of information that should be collected to inform service planning; and (5) identifying effective strategies that encourage geographical retention of practitioners. Of the top five knowledge needs, four were policy-related, suggesting a dearth of much-needed information to develop regional, evidenced-based surgical policies. The findings from this workshop provide a roadmap to drive locally led research and create a collaborative network for implementing research and interventions. This process could inform discussions in other low-resource settings and enable more evidenced-based surgical policy and service delivery across the SADC countries and beyond."

            "\n Background\n The increasing emergence and spread of multiresistant microorganisms in hospital wards is a serious concern. Traditional protocols are often not sufficient to protect patients susceptible to serious and life-threatening infections, therefore new strategies for decontaminating hospital environments are crucial to reducing microbial transmission and the spread the nosocomial infections. The adoption of modern technologies is indicated to supplement traditional methods and to improve desired levels of surface disinfection.\n \n Aim\n This work aims to report the development, implementation, and validation of cleansing and sanitizing procedure for critical clinical settings through the innovative use of disposable cloths pre-impregnated with solutions containing different active formulations and biocidal agents, relating to the areas to be treated (low, moderate, high-risk).\n \n Methods\n The implementation and validation of the sanitizing system were conducted in different wards of two healthcare structures. The protocol for the study involved a structured selection of representative surfaces, such as the floor, bathroom, desk, and beds. Microbiological analyses were performed according to ISO 4833-1:2013.\n \n Findings\n The efficiency of the proposed system was measured through the estimation of total microbial count values on the different surfaces before and after the sanitization operations by traditional methods and by the system described here. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in the microbial count that always fell below the threshold value. For the analyzed surfaces such as shower tray, bathroom floor, toilet edge, the traditional system had an effectiveness of less than 10%, whereas pre-impregnated cloths succeed to eliminate about 90% of the bacteria present. As an example, on the floor we observed a microbial count reduction from >42 to 10CFU/11cm2 with the new method (76% of colonies were destroyed), while with the traditional one we have a reduction from >42 to 28CFU/11cm2 (33% of microbial colonies).\n Moreover, the advantages of using this sanitization system are not limited to disinfecting surfaces and limiting cross-contamination but involve all activities related to the cleaning and disinfection operations, including the training and education of the operators and traceability of the operations.\n \n Conclusions\n The innovative disinfection and cleaning protocol used in the present study proved to be a highly valuable alternative to the traditional cleaning procedures in healthcare settings for the sanitizing process of all kinds of surfaces. All tools were specifically designed to improve disinfection efficiency and to reduce the problems associated with traditional methods, such as preventing cross-contamination events, limiting the physical efforts of operators, and avoiding incorrect practices. Our findings add support to the knowledge that an effective sanitization procedure is critical in minimizing microorganisms' transmission and cross-contamination.\n",
            "In recent years, the sanitization of environments, devices, and objects has become mandatory to improve human and environmental safety, in addition to individual protection and prevention measures. International studies considered ozone one of the most useful and easy sanitization methods for indoor environments, especially hospital environments that require adequate levels of disinfection. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the microclimate influence on sanitizing procedure for indoor settings with ozone, to prevent infections and ensure the safe use of the environments. The concentration of ozone was measured during sanitization treatment and estimation of microorganisms\u2019 survival on the air and different contaminated plates after the sanitization operations were performed. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in the microbial count that always fell below the threshold value in different conditions of distance, temperature, and relative humidity."

            "\n                  Background\n                  The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic currently prevails worldwide. To understand the immunological signature of SARS-CoV-2 infections and aid the search and evaluation of new treatment modalities and vaccines, comprehensive characterization of adaptive immune responses towards SARS-CoV-2 is needed.\n               \n                  Methods\n                  We included 203 recovered SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in Denmark between April 3rd and July 9th 2020, at least 14 days after COVID-19 symptom recovery. The participants had experienced a range of disease severities from asymptomatic to severe. We collected plasma, serum and PBMC's for analysis of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody response by Meso Scale analysis including other coronavirus strains, ACE2 competition, IgA ELISA, pseudovirus neutralization capacity, and dextramer flow cytometry analysis of CD8+ T cells. The immunological outcomes were compared amongst severity groups within the cohort, and 10 pre-pandemic SARS-CoV-2 negative controls.\n               \n                  Findings\n                  We report broad serological profiles within the cohort, detecting antibody binding to other human coronaviruses. 202(>99%) participants had SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies, with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and spike-ACE2 receptor interaction blocking observed in 193(95%) individuals. A significant positive correlation (r=0.7804) between spike-ACE2 blocking antibody titers and neutralization potency was observed. Further, SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8+ T-cell responses were clear and quantifiable in 95 of 106(90%) HLA-A2+ individuals.\n                  \n               \n                  Interpretation\n                  The viral surface spike protein was identified as the dominant target for both neutralizing antibodies and CD8+ T-cell responses. Overall, the majority of patients had robust adaptive immune responses, regardless of their disease severity.\n               \n                  Funding\n                  This study was supported by the Danish Ministry for Research and Education (grant# 0238-00001B) and The Danish Innovation Fund (grant# 0208-00018B)\n               ",
            "An effective but balanced cellular and inflammatory immune response may limit the severity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), whereas uncontrolled inflammation leads to disease progression. Older age is associated with higher risk of COVID-19 and a worse outcome, but the underlying immunological mechanisms for this age-related difference are not clear. We investigated the impact of age on viral replication, inflammation, and innate and adaptive cellular immune responses in 205 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. During the early symptomatic phase of COVID-19, we found that patients above 65 years had significantly higher viral load, higher levels of proinflammatory markers, and inadequate mobilization and activation of monocytes, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and CD8 T cells compared to those below 65 years. Our study points toward age-related deficiencies in the innate immune cellular response to SARS-CoV-2 as a potential cause of poorly controlled viral replication and inflammation during the early symptom phase and subsequent disease progression."

            "Background Nursing Assistants (NA) who feel empowered tend to perform their duties better, have higher morale and job satisfaction, and are less likely to leave their jobs. Organizational empowerment practices in hospitals likely shape the psychological experiences of empowerment among these personnel; however, little is known about this relationship. Objective We used qualitative inquiry to explore the relationship between organizational empowerment structural components and feelings of psychological empowerment among hospital frontline workers during a public health emergency. Methods Kanter\u2019s Theory of Structural Empowerment and Spreitzer\u2019s Psychological Empowerment in the Workplace Framework were applied to identify the conceptual influences of organizational practices on psychological experiences of empowerment. In-depth interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of NAs, caring for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Directed content analysis was performed to generate a data matrix consisting of the psychological experiences of meaning, competence, self-determination, and impact embedded under the organizational structural components of information, resources, support, and opportunity. Results Thirteen NAs (mean age\u2009=\u200942\u2009years, 92% female) completed interviews. Information , or lack thereof, provided to the NAs influenced feelings of fear, preparation, and autonomy. Resources (e.g., protocols, equipment, and person-power) made it easier to cope with overwhelming emotions, affected the NAs\u2019 abilities to do their jobs, and when limited, drove NAs to take on new roles. NAs noted that support was mostly provided by nurses and made the NAs feel appreciated, desiring to contribute more. While NAs felt they could consult leadership when needed, several felt leadership showed little appreciation for their roles and contributions. Similar to support, the opportunity to take care of COVID-19 patients yielded a diverse array of emotions, exposed advances and gaps in NA preparation, and challenged NAs to autonomously develop new care practices and processes. Conclusion Management and empowerment of healthcare workers are critical to hospital performance and success. We found many ways in which the NAs\u2019 psychological experiences of empowerment were shaped by the healthcare system\u2019s empowerment-related structural conditions during a public health emergency. To further develop an empowered and committed critical workforce, hospitals must acknowledge the organizational practice influence on the psychological experiences of empowerment among NAs."

In this review, we focus on the role of viral encoded RNA structures in genome packaging. We first discuss how packaging signals are constructed from local and long-range base pairings within viral genomes, as well as inter-molecular interactions between viral and host RNAs. Then, how genome packaging is regulated by the biophysical properties of RNA. Finally, we examine the impact of RNA packaging signals on viral evolution."
